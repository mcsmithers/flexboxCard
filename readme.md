# Material Design

The first thing I used was the material design fonts, components, and icons.  I recognized them and used them from Material Design. I went over to the CDNs for them so when the appropriate class gets called, they can get the right design.  The following consists of my resources:
*Buttons [https://materializecss.com/buttons.html]
* (Materialize CSS) [https://materializecss.com/]


# Flexbox
There are lots of ways to position things in the center, such as margins, positions, and flexbox.  I decided to go with flexbox.  Flexbox is a little tricky, so after a little tinkering, I got things positioned.  

To make the parts fo the card look like the design concept, I first made them each their own `div`.  In each div, I had to set row flexbox displays where I needed the child elements to be all in the same line as a `flex-row`.  Then for the ones that needed to align vertically, they would be displayed as a `flex-column`.  Once those were handled, it was time for more specific positioning.  I then had to center child elements where they needed it and also set them to align to the rightmost in situations like the buttons.  Finally, as a final step, it was time to add a little margin.  

The final step was setting up the drop-shadow, so after playing with the shadow after looking at the design CSS, I finally created a floating title and body section of the card with a 3D effect.

For the image I figured it woudl be fun to have a random image as long as it fit in the area.  I went with PlaceDog as I have a fondness for them and why not have a new one each load?"# flexboxCard"
